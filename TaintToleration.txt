Taints and Tolerations are mechanisms used to control how pods are scheduled onto nodes. They work together to ensure that only specific pods can run on specific nodes, based on certain conditions or constraints.

Taint: on nodes, Restrict which pods can run on a node.

Tolerations: on pods, A toleration is a property applied to a pod that allows it to run on a node with a matching taint.


Common commands

kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect

eg: kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchdule

kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint

kubectl taint node controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
# node/controlplane untainted
# dash means untaint action

kubectl get pods -o wide


Toleration config example:

appVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-pod
    image: myapp-pod
  tolerations:
  - key: "app"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect: "NoSchdule"
