# What is stateful?

# In Kubernetes, a StatefulSet is a workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Unlike a Deployment, which manages stateless applications, a StatefulSet is designed for applications that require persistent storage, ordered deployment, unique network identities, or stable pod-to-storage relationships.

# Deployment will be in order, create one by one ~

# StatefulSet must defint service name !!!!


# Kubenetes Headless Services

# a headless service is a special type of service that does not allocate a ClusterIP. Instead of providing load balancing or proxying, it allows direct access to the underlying Pods, typically through DNS resolution.
